# My photo library

This is my photo feed where I post my favourites. 
Itâ€™s easier to keep the best photos here than in iCloud library. 
I use Nikon D60 with 50mm Nikkor lens and 18-55mm lens (default one), 
but many of my photos I also took with iPhone 6s. Feel free to use them, 
and if it is possible please add a link to my website. Thanks!
