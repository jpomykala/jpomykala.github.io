        I'm a software developer. I started programming when I was 15. Since then, I build an Android game which was the
        most popular game in Poland for a while, finished my CS M.Sc. degree, and build two profitable startups. For +10
        years, I worked in a few companies, but I have never been fully satisfied with it. I
        worked as a consultant, software developer, component lead, team lead, and even a CTO of a few
        person software house. Currently, I focus on my own products, where I take care of programming and UI design
        even
        though I'm color-blind. ðŸ˜Ž

        You may find me on some social media services, but I'm not a fan of them, so I'm not active there.
        I try to keep my life private and keep a good work-life balance. ðŸ˜Š
