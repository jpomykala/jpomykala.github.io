    <h1>Hi, I'm Jakub!</h1>

    <p class="use-dashed-links">
      I'm a backend developer, who likes <strong>data visualization</strong> on front-end. Interested in software architecture,
      <a href="#projects">own projects</a>, and data charting. Passionate about JVM internals. Disappointed with the quality of
      software written these days, hates long methods and overcomplicated code.
      Occasionally, I <a href="/photos">take photos</a>, and <a href="/posts">write posts</a> about something what I think is unique and
      useful. I like to play in Sketch and create UI designs even though I'm color blind. ðŸ˜Ž
