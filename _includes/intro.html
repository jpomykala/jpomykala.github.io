    I'm a software developer. I started programming when I was 15. Since then, I build an Android game which was the
    most popular game in Poland for a while, finished my CS M.Sc. degree, and build two profitable startups. For +10
    years, I worked in a few companies, but I have never been fully satisfied with it. I
    worked as a consultant, software developer, component lead, team lead, and even a CTO of a few
    person software house. Currently, I work on my own products, where I take care of programming and UI design even
    though I'm color-blind. ðŸ˜Ž
