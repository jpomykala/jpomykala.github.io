    <p>
        I'm a software developer.
        I started programming when I was 15. Since then, I built an Android game which was the
        most popular game in Poland for a while, finished my CS M.Sc. degree,
        and I worked in a few software houses and startups.
        Currently, I focus on my own products, where I take care of programming and UI design
        even though I'm color-blind. ðŸ˜Ž

        You may find me on some social media services, but I'm not a fan of them, so I'm not active there.
        I try to keep my life private and keep a good work-life balance. ðŸ˜Š
