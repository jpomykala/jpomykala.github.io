Long time ago when I wanted to start a blog I was looking for the best way to do it. 
I really enjoyed the process of creating the designs and matching the UI elements together. I really never used that template, I'm using it now just as a template for my SaaS landing pages. 
Configuration is polished and ready to use, it's easy to create a landing page with blogging feature to write stuff which turns you on. ðŸ˜º
