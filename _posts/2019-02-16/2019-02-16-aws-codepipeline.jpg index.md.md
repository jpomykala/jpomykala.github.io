Travis CI, Circle CI, Circus CI, Jenkins, I am sure you know them all, but paying $60 per month for CI/CD tool for your
personal project can be to much (if you are not exposing your code to public on github, because in that matter you can use
just free Travis CI version for public Github projects. If you are familliar with AWS and their ecosystem you problably would like to use
their tandem CodePipeline, CodeBuild and CodeDeploy + source provider like Github/BitBucket. I use this solution in my own company RevCode and my two
projects which I'm currently working on. SimpleLocalize.io and VendingMetrics.com.
