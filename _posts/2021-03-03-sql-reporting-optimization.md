tags: ['database', 'sql']

This is my **list of the most commonly used and shared ideas on improving MySQL performance**. I will update this periodically because listing all tips at once would take too much time. ðŸ˜„
I tried to keep the points simple and short.

## Decrease number of connections to database

[RDBMS are ACID](https://mariadb.com/resources/blog/acid-compliance-what-it-means-and-why-you-should-care/) due to that fact most of the databases work on [single thread](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/2918/about-single-threaded-versus-multithreaded-databases-performance).
CPU to fake concurrent work (like playing music, moving mouse, and processing video) uses context switching.
Context switching is a process of saving data stored in CPU registers and restoring different data to CPU registers from cache memory. [More info](https://wiki.osdev.org/Context_Switching)
If you try to send many queries to database at once, concurrently by using multiple connections this will decrease performance. 
CPU will start switching the context more often to fake that concurrency and process every query "at the same time". 
Lower number of connections to database will queue queries and let the database to finish work faster.

### What server for a database?
Choosing a good server for a database we can sum up to following points: 
- high cache memory
- can be single-threaded
- high disk I/O (SSD)
- RAM is not that important as CPU and fast disk I/O

## Use indexes 

Instead of creating multiple indexes with one column, create indexes with multiple columns, and use them correctly. 
The column order in an index must be exactly the same as column order in `where` clause.

## Use window functions

All major RDBMS are supporting window functions and since 2018 MySQL 8.0 also have it!

## Use interval for dates

Let's imagine you can to query transactions between specific dates o from last 30 days. 

```sql
WHERE 
    DATE(created_at) > '2021-02-23'
```

Don't write date comparisons that way. It cannot use an index involving `created_at` because it is hidden in `DATE()` function call. 
Write instead:

```sql
WHERE 
    DATE(created_at) > NOW() - INTERVAL 30 days
```

## Summary tables

Create summary tables with **redundant data**. Sounds crazy? Ya, I know, but the idea isn't new, and I'm not the original author of this concept.
Sometimes when your database is near the edge of performance and there are many reasons to not upgrade it (costs!) then you can consider creating summary tables.

Creating complex queries and optimizing it sounds fun, but once your query have over 140 lines it's getting worse. 
You can pack them into SQL views or common table expresion, but constant updating it makes it really annoying in maintenance. 

Here is how it looks. Let's image I have many online `stores`. Each of them make some `transactions` with different payment types, like `credit_card`, `cash`.
Everything works good when you have only a few stores and number of transactions is fairly low. Reports are generated in a few seconds (max 3 seconds are acceptable).
It's getting slower when you have more and more transactions over time. You start with query optimization, adding indexes, checking the SQL engine and stuff. 
You can spin up a faster instance for a database and double the costs. On the other hand people are querying this data not so much often. 
It would be a huge waste of resources and money.

Summary tables for the rescue ðŸ¥¸

datetime | `credit_card` | `cash` | average | sum | store_id
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2019-10-01 | 543 | 14 | 15.2 | 8263 | 1
2019-10-02 | 263 | 56 | 12.4 | 8472 | 2
2019-10-01 | 853 | 58 | 6.8 | 9272 | 1
2019-10-02 | 873 | 43 | 5.2 | 7930 | 2

Transactions are stored in date groups. Now, you have to deal with much smaller number of rows to fetch and query. 
If store makes ~500 transactions each day, and you group them into days this will decrease number of potentially processed rows by 500. 
Instead of dealing with 100_000_000 rows, now you can just work only 2 millions.

You can update the summary table using SQL triggers, invoke code periodically in application to update it or calculate it in real-time in application code when a new transaction is inserted.


> Checkout also star schema and snowflake schema. It more advanced structure which is used to keep multi-dimensional data in SQL. Above example is just a easy to introduce solution. :) 

## Use cascades

Have you ever tried to delete some row from table but due to consistency check you needed to delete some other row before that? Instead of creating that weird 
chain of delete queries from every table which must be in correct order (to not break the database consistency) just use cascades. It won't hurt you, unless you know how to use them.

## Sort by id

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think most of the databases are returning data ordered by a primary index. This statement also works for MongoDB. We can use that fact
to quickly return data in correct order. If you want to paginate transactions by creation date which we usually do use `order by transaction_id desc`. The newest transaction will
go first, and database won't even need to touch an index of `created` column.

## Foreign key doesn't need to be numeric

Here is simplified model of translation data which may be found in many online systems who are still keeping translations internally instead of using [SimpleLocalizeâ„¢](https://simplelocalize.io)

translation_id | translation_key | translation | language_key
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | `HELLO_WORLD` | Hello world! | `en_US`
2 | `CREATE_ACCOUNT` | Create account | `en_US`
3 | `HELLO_WORLD` | Witaj Å›wiecie! | `pl_PL`
4 | `CREATE_ACCOUNT` | StwÃ³rz konto | `pl_PL`

If I want to search for translations for specific language instead of joining a `languages` table on numeric ID, I can directly query for translations with given `language_key` which is indexed.

## Use different technology

There are many services out there which can help in optimization. Instead of using you SQL database for every search, you can try out combine 2 technolgies.

### ElasticSearch

Use ElasticSearch for better full text searches. Using `like` keyword in SQL databases is not that efficient as in sepciaized tools for that job. 

### Apache Lucene

Instead, using whole ElasticSearch service you can just take advantage from Lucene indexes (which are used in ElasticSearch).
For Java and Hibernate you can use [Hibernate Search](http://hibernate.org/search/) extension.

### NoSQL

Use NoSQL database like MongoDB or DynamoDB to keep large JSON files. MySQL have special [JSON type](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/json.html) 
to find and extract data in JSON, but it might me not the best way to do it. It's up to you how many times you will deal with the JSONs and how good the JSON support is in your library.
