Many times I have an opportunity to talk with people who are really interested in what I'm doing. Leading a few small startups is really cool and adventurous.
I'm started to be a little annoyed how many people think that they also want to build a startup with me. It's really cool, but what is my benefit from 
being the MVP of a product? This is harsh. If you know how to create an API and know ReactJS it doesn't mean you can run a successful startup. Many people 
(software developers) who thinks that "hey, I will create an app for XY". Yes, you can but you know what? It's not going to work. Here is why:

## "How to start a software project." checklist

Here I listed stuff which you need to know or learn. I wrote it in passive aggressive form, sorry about that. üòâ

- You don't know anything about the **marketing**, unless you are marketer
- Do you know how to talk with people?
- Are you self-disciplined enough to work on your product every day? I work on one single product since 2017
- Do you know how to create a good-looking UI?
- Do you know how to create a usable UI with which will deliver a great UX? 
- What do you know about advertising?
- Do you know have metrics do you need to measure?
- Adding Google Analytics script doesn't make you data analytics
- Do you know how to create a good-looking landing page?
- What do you know about video editing?
- Do you know how to engage people?  
- You don't know anything about the **writing good content**
- Do you have an audience which could test or buy your product?
- No one cares about you and your product (this is harsh but true)
- No one cares about "Hey XY just launched on ProductHunt" üòÖ  
- Are you sure you can share valuable knowledge for the industry?
- Are you enough confident to show everybody your product?
- No one cares about most of your product functions
- Are you able to provide 24/7 support?
- You don't know anything about the **SEO**  
- Do you know how to create vector image assets for a project?
- Why people should your product instead some other? price is now the only factor nor number of functions
- Do you really believe in overnight success?
- If your product is innovative, then **probably** no one needs it
- No one cares how much you optimized that SQL query and if it's 200ms faster than before

*You are selling experience, yourself, your support and commitment.* 
Once somebody subscribes your product/service, then you are started of being a part-time employee of some company. 
You are a joker, problem solver of some specific area. 
If you are bored and careless guy, then I got bad news. 
No one cares about technical stuff about which you (and many others) are fascinated. No one cares if you build your 
product in ReactJS, Angular, Cobol, PHP, Reactive way, Non-blocking I/O or the newest NodeJS version.
No one cares about your project idea, you are not the only one who got them. 
You are not the first one. 
You are not the first one who got the idea and know how to execute it.

## Different areas
Are you able to split your work on many areas? Like:
- providing a support, 
- writing meaningful posts which are answering the questions from the community, 
- marketing your product, 
- constantly improving SEO, 
- advertising, 
- fixing bugs in your software, 
- introducing new functions

I put the 'introducing new functions' on the last place not by accident.

Most of your work should be automated.

I will write post about work automation and tools which I use in SimpleLocalize.
