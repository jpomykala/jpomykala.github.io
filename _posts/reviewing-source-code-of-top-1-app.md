If you read [my post about advertisements](/2021/01/04/startup-advertising) you must know that in 2014 
I also run paid campaign for this app. It was the only time when it worked! Maybe it was a coincidence, but I really get a greate benefit from it. 
I remember I paid about $500 for Facebook ads and Google apps. I was a good investment because app installs and money from adverts doubled very quickly!





Today Google reports that over 10 000 users still got this app on his phones.
