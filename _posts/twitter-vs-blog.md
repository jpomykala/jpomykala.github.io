What if we all switch to blogs instead of Twitter? Did you notice how Twitter become 
a joke medium or this is only my experience. You can easily categorize Twitter profiles.
At which point people will say 'okay, this is not for me'. What are alternatives? 
Why people are following Tim Cook? 
 
Does people see that some profiles are clearly about advertising and commenting only 
increases their traffic? How many times you saw 'Tell me what is your favourite XYZ', and 
author doesn't even care about the response, he doesnt comment the replays. I guess it's because 
the tweet has been scheduled. 

Why number of followers is so important? Why people are creating Twitter bots with GPT-3
to tweet auto-generated texts to get more followers. Does getting audience how liked auto-generated
text will also like your tweets? Does random audience will 

A perfect working use case for twitter is some celebrity or known person who really interacts with the people.
But they are known from other achievements rather than getting 500k random followers, thanks to GPT-3 script.
Communication like these wouldn't be possible.

Another perfect use case would be getting updates. In prefect world an official company profile would just
post updates what might be usefully. Instead we are getting another marketing crap just to remind people that
XYZ exists.

## Can we improve it?

I guess so. In my opinion and in my case, Twitter algorithm ruins the whole experience. It randomly proposes people's tweets
about which I don't care, people don't care and tweet author doesn't care. They are advertising profiles who just get 
worked on getting fake or random followers and likes. 

Many marketing resources, says you should tweet a couple times a day. 
This creates a huge amount of crappy tweets. Therefore, my another idea would be limiting number of possible tweets, to one per day. 
Imagine, you can post only once a day. "You better think what you want to say, because the next chance is going to be tomorrow."

## Similarities

- No one reads it my blog same as my tweets
- On both mediums you are trying to write something smart

## Differences

- Blog supports markdown
- It can have more than 280 characters
- Blogs are not recommending you other blogs with marketing sh*t
- On blogs you don't have to listen people who are overly enthusiastic
- On blogs you won't see "YoUr fAvOuritE ProgRamiNg LangUage THREAD üßµ"
- Writing a blog can improve your writing skills, Tweeting can give you a cancer
- Elon sometimes tweets something funny what starts a drama 


Choice is pretty simple for me.


## Twitter is eternal

Twitter won't die anytime soon, but I think people will get tired of it at some point. Same as it was/is with
Facebook, Instagram, Google+ etc.

## New trend

Recently, I saw in AppStore (top 1 position) an app called BeReal. It's like a social media app,
but it forces you to 'be yourself' or at least it tries. Rules are simple, you can post an image once a day,
and you have only 2 minutes to take the photo once you decide to do it. Another catch is that photo is taken from both camers, front and back one.
Another and even more important catch is that you see a preview only from the back camera, so you don't know how you look while you take a phpto.
Both photos are uploaded and shared with your friends. Pretty cool.

## From privacy-focused

Are the trends will shift to something more true? I guess so. First years of internet was fantastic, 
true knowledge, discovering things and new websites. Later we started making money on it, track everybody and everything
to maximize income and minialize costs, but the current trends is changeing. More and more organizations
decides to be more transparent, and straightforward with their actions.

- many newly created anonymous web trackers (this website uses Plausible.io)


## Tracking awareness

Currently, I'm using paid ads because it doesn't feel completely disagrees with my worldview. I'm annoyed
that I can "choose" the audience. I would rater to choose when my ads are showing, on which keywords.
People has been unknowingly categorized and classified because companies were tracking them to monetize those 
data. It wouldn be a problem if you could consciously say 'yes, im interested in these and use it to propose me better offers'

If you though that TikTok is a cancer, then Twitter is also a cancer but instead videos you got 280 characters.



I think I just miss Facebook where people where knowing each other. üíÄ
