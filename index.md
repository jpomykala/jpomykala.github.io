## Open Source

### [üçÉ Spring Higher-Order Components](https://github.com/jpomykala/spring-higher-order-components)

Library for Spring Boot web projects. Fills the thin gap between the framework and common web application features like e-mail sending, S3 uploading, request logging, rate limiter etc.

### [‚ö°Ô∏è SimpleLocalize CLI](https://github.com/simplelocalize/simplelocalize-cli)

Command Line Interface created for [SimpleLocalize.io](https://simplelocalize.io). It's great because it uses GraalVM to build native executables and in the same time it allows me to write code in Java 11. CLI is ready for enterprise usage. Code is open sourced and CLI is offered on MIT licensee.

### [üì∏ Javagram](https://github.com/jpomykala/javagram-bot)

Project created to test Java 11+ API, I do not recommend using it because it's not allowed to use that kind of software on Instagram, but the implementation is cool. 

### [ü§ñ Sentiment Analysis Experiment](https://github.com/jpomykala/SentimentAnalysis-Experiment)

Did you know that sentiment analysis is LESS accurate than a coin toss (accuracy 50%)? That‚Äôs terrifying if your brand makes strategic 
decisions based on such analytics. I made an experiment with Core NLP, Java 11+ and many IMDB reviews to test it. Checkout the results!
