Graphics editor with superpowers. No-code automation tool for creating images and PDFs. It's a part-time project,
it's a great way to just jump-in for a few hours to unwind after working on SimpleLocalize.

### ![placeflare](/assets/images/placeflare-logo.png){:class="round"} [PlaceFlare.com](https://placeflare.com)
TripAdvisor like app with hand-picked and worth visiting places around the World. From a technical perspective, the coolest feature is an ability to sort places by distance, thanks to Apache Lucene indexes.
I made this app for fun, to learn new technologies and play with them.
