I‚Äôm a software developer from Poland üáµüá±. Full-stack web development is my primary focus, but I also like to 
dabble with design and mobile apps. I like to visit unusual places, [take photos]({{site.url}}/photos), and [write posts]({{site.url}}/photos) about something what I think is unique and useful.
